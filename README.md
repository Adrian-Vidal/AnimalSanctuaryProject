## Lessons Learned

- I learned how to read and understand how to properly utilize the UML diagram. In this project, I found that it was easy to fall off the path provided by the diagram. It is there for a reason, much like a blueprint or guideline to help you achieve your goal.
- Working on this project really showed me the importance of positional awareness. A lot of times, I had the correct code, but it was not where it needed to be in order for it to work.
